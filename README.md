# KaseiCoin: Martian Token Crowdsale

![alt=""](Images/application-image.png)

## Background

The Martian Aerospace Agency accepted me into the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, I am to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token thatâ€™s ERC-20 compliant. I will launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
